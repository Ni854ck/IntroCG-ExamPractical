For the Goomba enemy I implemented a toon shader. I wanted to keep the iconic cartoonish look of the Goomba which was difficult with the change to 3D. The best way to do so was to add a Toon shader to give it a hand drawn look. The eyes of the Goomba however are making use of specular shaders to give the eyes a shiny look. The Ground is usingn Ambient lighting to make use of the light coming from all the various sources. Color grading was added to the camera to give the game a more saturated look to get closer to a cartoonish appearance in the style of the original game while the scrolling background textures make use of updated Mario visuals and assets to connect it with the franchise.
