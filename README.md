For the Goomba enemy I implemented a toon shader. I wanted to keep the iconic cartoonish look of the Goomba which was difficult with the change to 3D. The best way to do so was to add a Toon shader to give it a hand drawn look. The eyes of the Goomba however are making use of specular shaders to give the eyes a shiny look.
